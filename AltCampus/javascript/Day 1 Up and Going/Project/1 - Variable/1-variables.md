# Hello World!
  1. Make a index.html
  2. Write a function when called display "Enter You Name"
  3. Store the vlaue in a variable
  4. Alert the value like this `Good Morining John`

Implement it using internal and external Javascript.

  1. Write JS inside html file.
  2. Write the JS in an external file and link your html and js.


## Write `VALID` and `INVALID` infront of the variable name defined below
```js
var man;
var 1girl;
var woman3;
var -girl;
var blackDog;
var 42;
var $42;
var userName;
var x, y, z;
var x = 5, y = 6, z = 7;
var x = 5 + 10 + 2;
```

## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Mathematical Operations:
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.

// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.
```
Logical Operation
```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark
// Check who is younger
// Check if their age is equal
// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.
// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.

// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
```
## BMI

Two users (John and Mark) are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store users (John and Mark) mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs
3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
4. Print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Mark BMI is higher then John").
